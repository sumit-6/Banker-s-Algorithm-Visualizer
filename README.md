# Banker's Algorithm Simulation

<!-- ## Definition -->
A website that describes the implementation of Banker's Algorithm using queue datastructure.

**Banker's Algorithm is a resource allocation and deadlock avoidance algorithm that tests for safety by simulating the allocation of predetermined maximum possible amounts of all resources, and then makes an "safe-state" check to test for possible deadlock conditions for all other pending activities, before deciding whether allocation should be allowed to continue.**

# DescriptionðŸ§ 
This project includes simulation of Banker's Algorithm using double queue implementation (proposed by us).

One button will be provided to the user on the home page along with two drop down option to select number of resources and number of proceses for which program will be simulating the algorithm.

After that you will be directed to a page where you will be providing the resource values along with allocation and need of processes.
(For testing purpose, you can refer to input1.txt and input2.txt)
